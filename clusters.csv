com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,This thing is great. I am at the bottom of the learning curve but in the few minutes I have played with it it seems like it will be easy to learn and to use. Just what I hoped for.,February 27 2016,5,2
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,looks like a great program  1 of its kind I don't have the necessary hardware to utilize it though.,March 30 2016,4,2
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Unable to set sampling rate on infinix X2 with MT6753 Unable to set sampling rate on the hackrf one on phone with MT6753 processor.,December 13 2016,3,2
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Definitely worth $0.99 Only $0.99! Since the developer is quickly listening to user feedback - this app is probably going to be better than SDR Touch very soon! I have two wishes - Material Design  and remove the screen orientation settings to use Android's settings. Update: one of those wishes has already come true! The logo and name of the app is missing from the top right corner  though.,December 10 2014,5,2
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works ok  have a bug it seems  switching modes am to fm the sound disappears  if u restart the app  sound is back  until i change modes again. I9505 on kitkat. Other than that its a usefull app.,January 23 2015,4,2
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,BLU life xl works,November 23 2016,5,2
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Good job Tried a few . This has to be the most stable and best to my liking . And a whole world of settings to play with. However we are quite limited on frequency band width id like to see it lowered to 14.mhz if possible,July 19 2016,5,2
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,The bandwidth seemed to be limited to maximum 2 MHz or so. I tried to increase the bandwidth but not possible. I purchased this is because one of the pictures in the advertisement showed the 2.4GHz band with around 10MHz or more bandwidth. Is it not possible to increase the bandwidth? If not  it is just the same performance as other free APPs.,July 25 2016,3,2
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Amazing Love the added demos now. Using mine with hackrf. Also tested with RTL. Both work perfectly! Thanks for a great implementation.,January 20 2015,5,3

com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Nexus 10 works well Great app  works well on my Nexus 10.,January 07 2015,5,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Xperia Z Tablet Grabbed the app to play around with RTL SDR. Better signal clarity than SDR# on my laptop. Very happy so far with $15 total investment. Dongle powered up straight from the tablet. Don't have a HackRF to test.,March 11 2015,5,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Awesome. Works well on Amiko A3  OnePlus One/CM11 using RTL-SDR. Bargain price!,March 10 2015,5,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Excellent app Works great on my Note 8.0 and with a powered micro-usb-hub works on my Z3 compact too. Looking forward to scanning and would love to see audio recording added. Thanks :-),January 07 2015,5,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Perfect! What a brilliant app for the price. Works perfectly on my Oneplus One with RTL-SDR dongle and otg cable.,December 05 2016,5,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,The most fun you can have with a dongle ;-) Works perfectly with my Oneplus One and a generic RTL-SDR dongle. Well worth paying a few pence for to support the author.,June 18 2015,5,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Great app! The new version now works on my Bravia Android TV which is great as it's right by my rooftop aerial cable. The scan feature would be useful...any ETA on when this will be available? Also the option to import a list of bookmarks e.g. from a simple properties file would be useful.,October 12 2016,4,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works on Motorola Droid Mini. Very cool app. I would like to try and DF power line noise using this app coupled with the RTL-SDR dongle. nice job on the app!,July 16 2015,5,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Amazing A very useful app. I originally downloaded the free version from github  but decided to buy it here as the dev deserves the money.,August 10 2015,5,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,For €0.79 this app is 10x less expensive than sdr touch and for that reason I gave it four stars. There are some improvements needed such as setting squelch and bandwidth could be easier  recording audio as well as the entire band  there is a high-pitched tone when using wide band fm  a way that makes it easier to fine tune and stability improvements. This app works pretty well on my device (OnePlus 2) but it does crash every now and then (when changing between portrait and landscape for example). I think this app is great for the price and does pretty much everything I need but I would like to see these improvements.,February 20 2017,4,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Great It's not fully optimised and has some issues with crashing but still a nice app  especially considering the price and it's open source.,August 23 2016,4,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Great app! Works really well with Galaxy note 5,February 01 2016,5,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,"Works Great. Works great on a 2015 Medion Lifetab S10346 (MD99282). 10.1"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Android 5. Watson wideband 100Khz-2Ghz model W-SDRX1 rtl dongle based receiver. Mostly Amatuer Band and Airband use. HF and VHF-UHF receive is fine if you cn feed it from any half decent antenna farm  even works ok with indoor antenna systems with a bit more interference. It is possible to power the receiver from the tablet with the supplied usb otg cable but a otg cable with power in capablity is highly recommended. Great app  works as good as any windows  linux or mac sdr apps that I own. Fine Business to the developer. Wish that I could rate your app with more than 5 stars  makes it possible for me to go portable or mobile with the sdr without having to carry a laptop everywhere.""""",September 03 2015,5,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Fun app - A little tedious though I enjoy using this app but can be a bit tedious trying to get everything set and configured just right. Once your SDR dongle has been properly configured you can then enjoy using it. Nice little app :&gt;),September 24 2015,4,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works great I am using HackRF One with this apps.,January 29 2016,5,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Additional info Used it w/RTL-SDR (R820T) on my phone (Moto G) also and it works great there too. I already had FM on this phone and now have NWS  taxis  Aviation  Marine  etc. Hopefully scanner update soon. Love it! Have it also on my new Chuwi HI8 dual-mode tablet so you can add that to the list ,September 25 2015,5,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,App Great but This app is great but the only thing that's missing is its ability to store frequencies and presets like the competing app.,December 13 2015,4,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,awesome app  seems stable and runs well on Note 4 with RLT-SDR  can't wait to try it out on the HackRF One. Happy to support the developer!,November 24 2015,5,3
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Awsome App! Easy to use  works great on Notes w / Realtek dongle.,April 16 2016,5,3

com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,I'll forgo the refund. But no go with Watson dongle... Nexus 9. Yet to try on Nexus 6p. So very disappointed!!! :-(,March 31 2016,1,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works well with my Hackrf Hopefully new updates will arrive for extra functions,July 22 2016,5,4

com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works on a Nexus 6p I'm still messing around with my hackrf but it works with my Nexus 6p  Trond usb-c to usb host adapter. Thanks!,August 04 2016,5,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Squelch is non-existent in this app. The developer claims it exists but it is impossible to set up. No matter how I adjust the gain I always hear the RF noise in between the transmissions. This app will make me deaf. The only way to eliminate the noise is to manually move the dB slider up and down which very impractical and annoying. Every free PC SDR software has perfectly working squelch. Why this one doesn't? Could be a great app but luck of squelch makes it unusable. I would expect this to be fixed.,February 12 2017,2,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works well on Huawei Mediapad ML-802L and RTL,February 12 2017,5,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works with RTL SDR Works but no audio when demodulating,April 24 2016,3,4

com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Does not work Did not work with my rtl-sdr,May 23 2015,1,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Excellent job This app works great. No head aches   no yelling. I followed the instructions  downloaded the driver. My rtlsdr worked not a single problem. I can't get any rtlsdr to work on my desk tops. Thank you oh great one!,January 19 2015,5,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Nice Tested with Rtl SDR. Working fine although I saw weird behavior around 2.4Ghz. Not sure if this is the app. What is badly missing is some kind of bookmarks/favourites feature.,February 20 2016,4,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,doesn't work with rtl-2832 Says it works with rtl devices but doesn't. never displays anything  even though the rtl 2832 works with other spectrum analyzers. no help files anywhere so good luck figuring out what's wrong!,February 10 2016,1,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Amazing!!! Works like a charm! Nice feature to save recordings into file. Would be even better to transmit from file on HackRF! 73 SQ7MHZ,March 20 2015,5,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Awesome work - thanks for open sourcing! So happy to discover this project. Thank you so much for the first GPL open source Android sdr spectrum explorer I've seen. Very exciting. It's also great that you've made it easy to put a $ in the tip jar via the app store. I'm really jazzed about RF Explorer! Keep up the great work! Other features it would be wonderful to see in future versions (these would be icing on the cake!): - DC offset correction - Audio gain control - (maybe even audio spectrum display?),March 21 2015,5,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Simple and perfect About this software rtl sdr is very useful ... installed done. Thanks.,November 08 2015,5,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,This works great so far. Any plans for support of Q branch direct sampling for HF reception on RTL SDR? Maybe the option is there and I missed it. Great app  keep up the great work.,October 12 2015,5,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Nice Work Wish it could transmit too on Hack,October 04 2015,5,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works on Nexus 9 Perfectly works on Nexus 9 with RTL-SDR!,April 02 2015,5,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Working great with RTL Great job! This is working great with my RTL SDR. Well worth the money! Keep up the great work dev!,April 17 2015,5,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Good Works well on Oneplus One  with and without a powered otg cable,August 23 2015,5,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works great with rtl Sdr and HTC one x Thanks very much.,August 18 2015,5,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works ok Please improve tuning... Add possibility to tune like PC SDR software by flipping digit up/down. Currently it's too many taps to fine-tune,May 23 2015,4,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works Great App works well with rtl-sdr usb dongle except that it has a much more restricted freq range than a competitors app with the same dongle. Possibly a user error. Ie can not tune below 24Mhz. Get out of range error. Hoping this is user error as the support and upgrade path from this dev appears to be much better than competitors app. UPDATE: After response from Dev. it appears that the app is correct the tuner in my dongle has a24MHz lower limit  The competitors app appears to tune much lower ( doesn't throw error and has signals) but it is not actually tuning lower. After purchase support for this app is superb. Can't wait for future updates. Thank You,January 19 2015,3,4
com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Sweet Pick your source device in settings. Default is hackrf. May need driver as well,February 01 2016,5,4
