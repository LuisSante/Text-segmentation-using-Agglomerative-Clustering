The audio keeps getting ups and down. Loud one moment and low the next. The instructor has a loud feedback but the students has low audio feedback. I can't hear my classmates speak while my instructor can hear them perfectly. The audio is breaking up. The 'To do List' in the desktop version is not loading. Full screen mode should be automatically landscape where you don't have to turn on the auto rotate in the phone itself.
Won't download for some reason
No value if I can't even get into the app.

"Great app, I only rated I 3 because sometimes you open the app, and it just doesn't load, it takes forever to upload a photo/video to an assignment, and it also doesn't make the categories in order from new to first, teachers who are new to tech have confusing classrooms because of this."
I just rilly hate school but also the app doesn't want to work

This has been plaguing me for the past week as I had many many assignments that weren't available. Also I forgot to mention but I cleared the cache forced stopped and even switched to a different internet, NONE OF THESE WORKED. 500 character limit is the worst."

Terrible app I hat it
Great app when its works but very buggy for me most of the time and id much rather hand the homework into my teacher than submit it on here
its school related >:(
Meh... another reason I dislike Google. I only had to install and use this app because my middle schooler's private school uses it for classroom assignments. Everything about Google apps give me the dry heaves. Just getting the apps set up alone are enough to send me screaming...or drinking. My dislike for how cumbersome Google is persists. Even took back a Google Android OS TV that just drove me mad. Going to be a painful few years for me using Google Classrom.
Wont show me my most recent class work Glicthes a lot
I hate school so I hate this apl
Won't even let me in! The most useless frustrating app I have no idea why my son's school are using it I refuse to even download it. They'll have to connect with me another way. If I could minus stars I would.

Not a very good app
Crashes most of the time

"Why does this keep saying that it would not refresh my class ? Everythime I use this app, it keeps saying that it would not refresh the class. This is disappointing. My data and wifi is completely fine. Still, not yet I could refresh my class. If this bug or whatever this was, wasn't fixed, it would be just as futile as it was. Edit: I did everything I could to make this fixed, but nothing happened. And I can't clear app caches since I need them all for schooling."
This app is horrible its so laggy and it does not submit my assignment I got an F- because of this app my teachers think I was too lazy to do my work and now I'm failing my classes also most of the work does not load and when I re-open it it kicks me out do better google Classroom!!!!!! 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡🤬🤬

"Horrid, very inappropriate for children."
I always upload a pdf but most of the time it shows drive file. When I try to unsubmit my work it doesn't work. Hence because of this problem my assignment are never on time and always shows handed in late. Very much dissatisfied with this.

How is the app top 3 in n education when it only has 2.2 stars? Clearly there's favouritism going on
Grug say one bad word. Gurg get kicked from class. Grug mad 😠 😡.
This should be 0 star. I can't add my account in this app so I have to use chrome just to enroll and pass my seat works in my classes:((. Sometimes there's a problem like I already submitted my work but after the other day I checked it says I haven't submitted my work. Please solve this problem😠

služi za skolu sve vam je jasno zasto 1 zvezdica
The app doesn't show my work in the to do place so I have to go to each class. Which would be okay if I only had a few classes but I have about 9 including my extra credits. This app crashes quite a bit and I've tried on different devices and it's just the app. It's a good concept just not well executed. Adding later. It's still the same but now I keep getting un enrolled in my classes. I hate that I have to have this app to do my important work. It barely works

This is the worst app ever!!I literally hate it I was looking for an assignment then it decided to kick me out! I opened the app again then it said that Google Classroom wasn't working and I just annoyed me so much. Plus when I tried to make a Google Classroom it didnt allow me to and that was so stupid. Google Classroom is the worst. Plus when I tried to invite the teachers to join it didn't let me and It kicked me out then when I opened it again it crashed on me. DON'T DOWNLOAD IT!!! 😪

Dumb hoe
Scammed me ever since 2020
I just don't like school
I hate school
This app is simple and organized. but I do say that it can be hard to keep up with assignments to do there.
Everybody give this one Star so it will get kicked off the app store
This app and service have no way for a parent to interact. The emails that parents receive are nearly useless and there is no way to properly sort in the student's login. Basically you have to scroll through every assignment to get an idea of what is happening. It's a total time suck. It gets one star because there is at least some visibility into my child's work and curriculum. Otherwise it would be zero stars. Do better Google.
Bad
Stupid

Whenever I try to turn in a assignment and it either takes forever or never sends.
"so hassle to save the file offline then download it from google drive, sometimes it doesn't appear on my offline files on drive, waste of time, why did you remove the download option directly from classroom?"
Remember 2020 when everybody rated this 1 to get it taken off the app store. Let's do it again.

"Bring back the downloading files option back. Save files offline isn't a useful feature, it takes very long time to download."
I got this app for school (obviously) but after a few months it's stopped working so I have to use the really gross ipads in school to do the work now. It doesn't get updates when there's new work so I have to do the homework in school.
L app

"I liked the app at first, But honestly reviewing everything on my iPad from the past 4-3 years it's really..rough. I had so many issues with starting the app, Getting work done, It's really awful on mobile devices, And I hated switching back and forth from computer/laptop to iPad/phone. It consistently stopped midway through my work and I'd have to restart EVERYTHING all over again. The app can be fairly slow too, And honestly it's really annoying to restart everything. Wouldn't recommend at all"
"Cant opnenmmy accout, keeps erroring, needs a permission and i dont even know which permission it talks about. This app has been on my device for a year but hasnt used it once because of the error and therefore this has contributed only stess to me. I cant rely on this app. Total 100% waste."
Google classroom is a good app but sometimes it does something to my chromebook and I don't know what it is?

Please fix it"
"This is litterally the worst app I have ever seen, If I could rate it 0 stars....

"only after a few months Google classroom stops working and I can't see any of my homework or classwork, it always says ""there is a problem with your internet connection"" even though it's working just fine, I also try to uninstall it and re-download it but it never works. Google classroom clearly doesn't work on mobile(android in my experience)"
Really hard to use

Kung kailan deadline saka pag mag o-occur yung ganito. Experienced this already 2 times. Please please please fix this google team. As a student, nakakadagdag stress pa po ito."

"My experience in this is so bad, because I can't post my work using a link it say ""Connection is slow try again"" but my speed of my internet was Good and stable on 20ms , why I can't share the link of Google Drive on my subject using a link?... I want you to fix this issue because me as a student I'm also just using phone, and I can't even buy expensive laptop,, this app is the worse that I ever use on this online distance learning....."

Kakastress mamamatay na kame sa mga pinapagawa
It is WILD how slow this app is. Photos take like 45 seconds to load. Is it 1997? How is Google OK with putting its name on a product this bad? EDIT (response to the response): I'm not attaching anything. Simply trying to view photos someone else attached. It should not take this long for photos to load.
School is poop
Kabaaad
Suck not working
It doesn't work
Dartiest app for ever why you make this app because teacher sending full homework and how we can join class room I don't know

Horrible on the phone and lagy at school

"What happened? The last months, my experience on this app has always been great. But since last week, I am no longer receiving notifications if there are any new requirements and announcements that my professors posted. Everytime I refresh the app, it always says the date where I first downloaded it which is September 21, 2019. So I always open my laptop to see if there are any new announcements or requirements posted and its kind of a trouble for me when I don't have my laptop Please fix this."
I had to do homework
Unable to submit my work since yesterday. It kept saying work unable to submit eventhough i tried it many times now.
They make you do work and shoot you if you dont do it

值得第六颗星
This app is not opening any pdf which we submitted in classroom
"When I take classes with fullscreen mode, notifications and my own profile appear on the screen which makes it difficult to take classes."
"First time use everything runs ok. Later on suddenly I cannot give annotation to students work. I have uninstall and reinstall. It runs well again. But after several weeks, problems occured, I cannot open my student's sent photoes. It said ""cannot preview picture"". My phone oppo reno F2. If I have to uninstall and reinstall again everytime problems occure is very troublesome."
"Worst app ever, never able to attach any file"
I can't turn in assignments i have 6 assignments that i have done but i can't turn it in every time i try to turn it in it says work not submitted please fix thid
Bad just bad if I can give a 0 stars I would
The files that I attached is always not available even tho I check it multiple times.
"Why there is ""UNABLE TO PREVIEW FILE"",how i'm gonna fix this"
"The mobile app is terrible, it take forever to update status on assignments and won't reload no matter what. It will say that assignments are turned in late or missing for a few days. I'm giving it a one star because it gave me notifications on new assignments and due dates. Other than for notifications, the app is basically useless."
Can't open files
It makes me want to cry because I actually have to do my work and not tell my teachers that I lost it
"It won't let me unenroll from classes, which clogs the rest of my actually active classes. It also won't accept videos or images no matter how many times I try."
Bad 👎
It's just kind of slow
It sucks
Unable to preview pdf in class room notes
"Lately, none the files are previewing themselves. I can only see them once they are saved offline and then viewed in the Google drive. Please fix this."
cannot open the media file in the post. Please fix it!
The classroom stinks it is controlled by the teachers and most of the time it's not accurate of my grades.
"I have been unable to preview any PDF documents in the app for over a week, making the app impossible to use for me. Reinstalling the app temporarily resolved the issue but now one day later nothing works again and reinstalling no longer helps. Overall I am really disappointed in Google for creating such a rushed and unpolished product."
Pictures won't load
Burik bet
I can't access to any activities in my class using phone.
"I can attach my work but whenever I open them, it's always unavailable to view😭😭😭 even the photos that my teachers attached I can't even view them, guess im about to fail, jk, pls fix it already!!! I have a lot of schoolwork to do this ain't helping😡, if I fail it's ur fault,jk, pls fix it😀."
Always have trouble in previewing file.
Koduma
"it always say ""Unable to preview file."" please fix this or tell us how to fix this.Thank you for the feedback."
"All my attached files became ""Unable to preview file"" what do I do to make it available? I'm worried my teachers won't see it and mark it as zero. Please fix it."
can't see announcements and refreshing takes a long time.
"I have been attaching my file to turn in my assignmenf but when I tried to preview it to check, an error message appeared ""unable to preview file"". I tried to refresh and uninstall then install it but I still can't preview my attach file. Please fix this asap. I need to turn in my assignments and exams this week."
It sucks
"Still can't view attachments. The app installed is surely up to date, have tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, restarting my phone, clearing cache as suggested and I'm pretty sure that there is no problem about the file's permission since it can be open using browser but not with the app."
Homework is a punishment and should never existed...
Best
"BEEN USING THIS FOR A LONG TIME BUT RECENTLY I CAN'T VIEW MY FILES. ""UNABLE TO PREVIEW FILE"" IT SAY. WHY? HOW? BECAUSE OF LATEST UPDATE MAYBE?"
Videos upload too slow when using data. No visual confirmation on where the upload is in currently in progress.
"I have used this app for 9 months and have no problems with it, but the other day I can't seem to open files and it always said ""Unable to preview file"" I am always frustrated because I can't open the files attached to that one folder. The file could always be previewed through Google drive but now I can't, I really don't know what happened but this has happened just now."
"I can't understand why, but on my Oneplus Nord CE, I have lost the ability to open files uploaded on Classroom with the last update. No matter what I try to use to open the link, even with external apps it just won't open anything, and if I try to download the files it returns me an error message saying that nothing could be downloaded. You've literally got billions of dollars of budget, PLEASE fix your apps before releasing an update instead of churning outuseless UI changes."
Many bugs which is annoying
After the new update. I am not able to open pdfs in Google classroom.
I wanted to give this a 0 rating because it doesn't even work whenever I try to open it the other account comes and when I open my account so the app closes.I can't even work with this.
Nice app
If there were 0 star option I will give it that because when we try open it is saying to login but when we login it said please try again later or add new account I have added also but it is showing like this only.. Plz fix this problem plz it is very important for me to doing the classes
One star..masyadong ginalingan maraming nalabas na aktibiti🤣
"""Unable to preview file"" showing when I open files in classroom. And the files turned into black. These things are happen to my works also. Offline files only able to view in drive"
Messed up my whole reputación
"I keep getting ""unable to open preview"" when clicking images posted by teachers. I can see the image thumb but can't open it in a larger view. However, I found if you click the edit icon, only THEN the image is viewable at larger size. I've tried force closing and restarting the app, but the problem persists... My internet connection is fine, as I can see the previews, just not click to open for larger view. The error resides on your in-app page that opens image attachments for more details."
"Please fix the ""unable to preview file"""
"After last update I can no longer open and pen annotate student work. Makes app useless. I have reinstalled and cleared data and cashe...no help...update, fixed by deleting my Google account from the tablet and then reconnecting, worked but didn't save and now same problem."
I can't attach my files
This app is very useful but I can't open the files uploaded by my professors to answer. That's why my written task are incomplete. I already uninstalled it and reinstall but still the same. I can't still review the files. Please kindly fix the app.
Horrible
cringe
Unable to open files
Minsanayaw magopen ng mga file🥴
"Files are unable to be opened and marked. Only workaround is to uninstall and reinstall. Clearing cache, data, force stopping, restarting does not work. Please assist me, I cant be reinstalling after marking a few papers."
"Google classroom isn't properly working for me everytime Im going to open the files uploaded in classroom it said"" unable to preview file"" plss fix this!!!"
Stupid
"What happened to my gclass?! Everytime I upload picture or file in my class, it always say ""unable to preview file"" and when try to use the open with button, it says that my files are corrupted. I'm having a hard time now to open the pictures/files that I sent. Please I'm begging you to fix this."

"Since last update, application is not performing well sometimes it shows issues while marking the students assignments and sometimes it doesn't even show the previews, doesn't open the pdf that has to be checked. I reinstalled application many times but issues are still there."
Recent update made accessibility worst
Doesn't work on mobile

"I don't know what happened to my google classroom, it's keep unable to preview the file, i have checked my gogole drive and my Internet , it's fine. But i must keep uninstall and install to view the file. Please fix this problem"
terrible nevewr works on my chromebook!!
it sucks
"The app does not let me connect to my work profile. Right when I set it up in my phone, a pop-up comes up and says ""We are sorry, but you do not have access to Classroom. Please contact your domain administrator for access."" This does not make sense, as regular PC Classroom works perfectly for me, with that SAME ACCOUNT. This is very irritating. I'd appreciate it if you took a look into it."
This app is just discussing I got sexually harassed and I want my money back

"My google classroom suddenly stopped working , it wasn't showing any assignments so I reinstalled it all over again....now it isn't let me get in my account, I am unable to login ..what's wrong with the app :|"
Worst school app
L APP
To many bugs
"To-do list takes too long to load. Prioritize that, please. It's very stressful to see that you've ""missed"" a deadline when it's just your system lol. And nope, my internet connection is not poor. Going to Chrome and opening it there will work but what is the point of this app if you will have me go to Chrome just to load my tasks properly. I am aware there are alternatives but this is something you have to fix."
Paki ayos namn po hindi sya nauubusan ng activity eh

Try again or discard"". So I can't create & save my posts & I can't actually ""save drafts"" either, so now I can literally do NOTHING in this app! Bad app on Samsung devices! 05/24/22: Still unable to use Google Classroom!!!"
Horrible
please fix the bug because i couldn't attach my files even though my internet is stable. i already tried several times but it seems to be not working.
App is not functional most of the time.

"Hasn't refreshed since September, and never works when I do try to refresh it. Frustrating and effectively useless"
It is the best

If you're a student like me you shouldn't use this app. It's unreliable and has no standards for getting your work done
Itna class class 😫

I used to see my classes and now it's saying something went wrong try again. I uninstalled and reinstalled and nothing happened
Can't do anything without it kicking me out

"Downloading Files was too slow, Your advice isn't effective either I've been waiting for 3 hours and yet you can't download a file that only contains 5.0MB"
Worst app in both performance as well as its purpose. I give a star only for telling my sorrow of using it and nothing else is deserved for this app.
I can't annotate my Students PDF.
This dose not work for me I don't get to do work

As a student using this i could say it's not good we use it for learning new language ..i couldn't copy the text in it to translate it ..i couldn't make a voice note and we couldn't chat with other students private

"Very slow loading, better view the classroom on chrome than this app. Doesn't update my to-do list, and missing. Needs a fix."
"I've been trying to login to my account but it keeps showing me an error that says it failed to log in and that I should try again. Reinstalled it a lot of times but kept seeing the same error. I'm positive my account email is correct as well as my password. When I tried to add an account, it keeps saying the account is already registered in the device. What gives?"

Per non parlare dei boss, i professori, non si riesce mai a capire la mossa giusta per batterli. Le penalità se non si riescono a battere i boss o a fare le missioni sono molto brutte, tipo i 4 e le note."

This is trash I can't save my answers in the Google docs and I'm super sure that this app is not really updating their bugs or problems because 3 months of not able to save my answers in my google docs this is the number 1 problem they have and I want this to be fix because it's annoying and stressful not able to use the docs to answer Learning tasks or questions that the teachers assigned to us students. And this thing has a problem for not opening files like this file is not able to open.
Too Bad
Made my life suck
It's so useless it's literally like being a bird and not being able to see glass!! I hate it.
It says I don't have access to my school email but I do
"Since it's last update on April 8th 2022 Google Classroom has been giving multiple problems. It's stops editing the file in the middle, doesn't save the edited work or the screen freezes making it seriously difficult to mark assignments as all work goes to waste. Every single time have to uninstall it and then reinstall it just to get it to work again. This has been happening since the last update."
"My internet is really good but it wont let me open the slides my teacher posts,it always says ""connect to internet"" when my internet is already strong."

"Every time I upload assignments, the name changes to ""Untitled"" which cost me to lose marks... 😠😡😠 Please fix this issue ASAP!!"
doesn't work anymore
La verda es que es una buena app pero lo que si le gana es que ocupa mucha memoria entre mandar lo trabajos se demora demacuado en ponerlos para enviarse y deberia ser una app sin inyernet para que todos puedieran aprender y no solo los con internet Lo otro es que se lleva usando casi 3 años y la verdad deveria ser mejor para uno como integrante y como creador de algun tablon

Why do i even go to school just to use an app that dont even even work like how google said it would. Storage waster😒🤨😶🙄😒🙄😑😑
Hello this app sucks cuz of skool and im way 2 cool for skool
It closes whenever I save a checked and edited document.
I am unable to Sign out from Google Classroom

Didn't refresh every time I open it. Late notification always
It doesn't let me login
my classes haven't been showing up for months and now I can't use my phone camera for my assignments. please fix this because now I might fail my classes.
Really bad and hard to use buggy as well
It's horrible and here's why it randomly kicks you out of it and unsubmits your work and it's very deceptive since Google will never take down their own app since they own this and they will never listen to the customers boycott this curropt Google app and Google itself and parents should write a bad review like I did for my child I care for my children but Google doesn't
"I only get the option to start new, and can't just sign in. Bruh, if I'm using a phone, this isn't first grade, is it?"
App is not installing from last 12 hrs
XУЙНЯ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's terrible
This app breaks all the time and i cannot stand it anymore
"Why can't I add forms to the classroom anymore??? I add them... I save it as a draft... And then none are attached anymore or only one or two will stay attached. This app use to work very well. Not anymore, too many issues and inconsistencies."
They're very rude I cannot sign into my class room
Can't even upload at least 2 minute video and a photo it says null
"Can't open videos that are in the stream, pls fix it. Videos only appear black then exit you out"
This app doesn't save the edited file after upgrading my phone

"Since it's last upgrade on April 8,2022, it's having multiple issues. The app doesn't save edited work, gives screen freeze and just restarts at its own leaving your work unsaved and wasted. I am having serious trouble marking assignments and it's all since it's last update. I have tried clear cache, it doesn't solve it. I have to uninstall and reinstall to make it work."
Worst app I ever downloaded 🤢
"Worst app. I try so many times to upload and everytime server rejected. Its so annoying and frustrating. When students work hard and finish their assignments on time. But due to faults in app, they have to suffer."
Very bad aap
I don't like Google classroom
"Pls the app is irrevant and very annoying......its job is only to take data,even a snail runs faster than this app.I wanted to open an attachment but it dosen't work,it just keeps on loading and draining my data.A few days ago i tired to sumbit an assignment through an attachment but it refused to work!!,i tried several times and it still didn't work....I think there are some major problems that needs to be seriously fixed so please try to fix it😡😡"

"Dear google classroom's developers, please fix your app system again because often when I am going to submit my assignments, a pop up message says ""Something went wrong, check your internet connection and try again"" appears. In fact, my internet is stable both using WiFi and using internet data. Please don't trouble students!!"

Very lagi and tati
Putangina ang bagal magsend ng activity
Not very good. Somehow difficult to organize what to do on this
Doesn't work on Google phones! Previously used this app as my children's school uses Google classroom so was handy to keep up with what they needed to do. But since switch ed to a pixel phone it won't work. I have seen lots of other s complaining of the same thing. Seems rediculose to have a Google product that won't operate on a Google device!
"1.Toooo slow to download or open files pdf or .png that the teacher put in the class room we can upload or download or edit faster in WhatsApp or any other applications Too slow to upload videos ... I tried to update the app and clear cash The pdf file can be opened in WhatsApp in less than 3 sec but in this classroom it take more than 3 minutes really very strange ,I had this app on alot of devices in my home but all was slow in opening and editing files You should find a solution please"
"Sometimes, I didn't get notification class assignment 😕"

The worst appppppppp
Bakwas
I hate school
"There was this time when I passed ""LATE"" ALMOST every tasks assigned because of the fact that the app itself didn't notify me on the first place. It neither tells me when did the teacher upload the assignments nor when was the deadline. Plus, the last time I checked the notifcations, it suddenly spammed past notifs that I have already seen few days ago. Additionally, reattaching files each second especially images is such an extremely huge struggle for us. Minimize the lags too, thank you."
Doesn't load any classes and kicks me out of the app.
I hate
School
But la bata
Bad experience
Sucks. It's for school so obvy it sucks

"This app was very handy and user-friendly BEFORE. But errors are annoying. Since January of 2022, It is difficult to upload and attach videos,pictures,links and files in ""your work"". That's why I ended up submitting my works in the private comments. And last week I had submitted a feedback about the problem in turning in assignments. I can't write a private comment, tap the mark as done and attach anything. My teacher found it hard to check my homeworks aswell. Please fix this problem asap!"
You'll need to fix whatever cause it not to work when using data

I rate this one star because it doesn't give me a notice saying I have an assignment that's missing and I get an f on it. It would be helpful if you had a notice for that so I can get it done a lot faster. The app takes forever to load when I get in so I get out and back in and works just fine. It takes forever for it to load everything.
Bad
I hate school
"Just downloaded it to give it one star, because the service is used to spam my mail account with invitations. Because why would a billion dollar internet company think of such possibilities? Especially after it already happened with their other services?"
For some reason it wouldn't load recent school work that I have to do so I uninstalled it then reinstalled it. But now it won't let me log in saying that I don't have access to Google classroom
It's just trash

It's so frustrating whenever I open a different app and went back to the classroom it exists the previous file that I opened, whenever I try to open a file or crashes and exits the app, you can't download the file directly or with the same time you'll have to- ITS JUST SO STUPID! You'll have to open drive just to download the file directly so if you have to download multiple files you'll have to do it one by one. I HAVE MORE TO SAY!!"

"Terrible. Couldn't link child school account. After selecting it just sat whirling. I left it and checked an hour later and it was still trying to link it. Not sure why I would need to reinstall considering I'd only just installed it. Sorry, but messing with accounts doesn't sound like a good recommendation either."
It has a lot of errors the video I upload doesn't load at all.
Una garcha
I can't unarchived class.
Why can't my email for school log in.
"Honestly, for 2 years using this app as a student makes it so much hard. Why? Because it doesn't even update the class updates and assignment details unlike using it in the PC, it's easy to use G-classroom in PC rather than the mobile version. Worst Google App."

However, my adviser revealed that the resolved Drive folder link was ""unredirecting"" here due to the alert that says no date to preview. In summary, this app sucks."

I got all those covered, no need to remind me anymore thank you ✋"
It's a really useless app it's laggs behind even when downloading
It's not worth it. I use this for school and I have multiple classes I've had to leave and I can't leave I have to wait for the teachers of the classroom to kick me out. It says that I have missing assignments when I dont. This is my personal email but it's not worth it for schools to use it.

App stopped working entirely after one month and it thinks that I have not turned in assignments that have been turned in multiple times. Now this app also thinks that it is in the past and I am seeing assignments pop up from teachers that were uploaded months ago.
It says I have a F In all my classes when I should have an A something is definitely wrong with this app

"It always says ""unable to view file."" It doesn't matter what file it is, whether photo, video, pdf or document, it says that.

Its take a very long time to upload file
SO MANY ASSIGNMENT

But now, i cannot since you've removed the download option. Lol I also cannot take screenshot of the files my prof had sent me. I don't have a stable connection and taking screenshots of my modules is one of my alternatives to view my modules/files. I hope they bring back the old version."

Bro it just be terribleeeeee
To many assignments.
"Can you take off the notification bar near the submission botton, it's takes too much time to disappear"
School.
"I cannot submit my file, always saying. Resubmit and contact prof. I misses the deadlines"
"Hey... can you check rates from Russians? They are talking about ""Teachers"", who send some ""task"" to their gmail. They say, it is like the ""Blue Whale"" nowadays..."
I try to log onto Google classroom as my school login and it keeps saying you don't have access to classroom what should I do
Ño
Why did you did this to us 😭
i hate you for making this now i have to do what i didnt do in online school 😡😡😡😡👩‍🌾
"This os the worst app I ever used. It always show that sorry,something went wrong while my network speed.5 Mb per second"
I can't see another students work in assignments
sfruttamento minorile
Notif ndak muncul :V notification not appearing :V
"To do list take too many times to load, it's normal?"
Ang hina mag load
So buggy and I can't see the Google slides because it won't let me press it and I try and tell my teacher in private and I can't because it lags out
Bleh
It uses a lot of mobile data ... It have used almost 1gb of my mobile data 🥺🥺
lagi nadadagdagan task ko
Wag nyo na lagyan ng deadline tsaka dapat 1 activity lang araw araw HAHAHAHHAHA
Poop
can\t groom chjildtren xd
Worst app
"it unable to log in when i key in new password, it show said device problem? Pls Fix it"
Di mahutdag activities. Napay narrative/reflection taas pas akong pasensya.
Fix this shti
Pp
Fantastic solved everything I struggled with
Very poor and loading for a long time pls fix it
"I have an assignment to do in 2 days, and if i fail to do it I'll lose 40 points. So thank you google, your broken app just made me lose 40 points. It won't update my assignment 🚮🚮🚮. keep up the great work👍"
"Developer said that I should update or shut down my phone. Done that, however still no improvement. Much worst, the files finally doesn't load. Clear the ache: done. Still same result."
I cant since in on my phone and it's hard to submit work on time and it is not a good way to ask Q's to teachers
Not using properly it's saying that the account is lacking everytime I have uninstalled and checked but it's the same issue again and again
Too much assignment.
Bhosari
One of the worst apps in the history of apps
It's good. The only problem is that once a lecturer post a note. Clicking it to view full content will give you an empty field. I can see attachments but not their instructions. One has to go to the mail account which is inconvenient. I speak of reading notes posted alongside the files.
I keep getting works........ Due to this app
Add more features.
This is constantly lagging this site does not work rule34.xxx is much better it never lags and the assignments are graded fast do not download instead use rule34 its much easier to use and very simple with no download required!!!
Why is it I CAN'T OPEN THIS app it say that classroom keep stopping
Masyadong madaming activity kaya ekis
Sucks need to get fixed
Unsatisfied so many activity they can post. Please in your next update you can limit the activity that they can post you select only 2 activity they can post in this apps.
"Annoying. It lags a lot, I've already handed in my assignment yet its on the 'missing', that lag is okay for me. But what's annoying to me is the amount of time I need to upload things. Literally just one photo and it'll take you several minutes. I kept trying to upload my assignment since 9 pm yesterday, the due date was 11:59pm yesterday. Now it's missing and I still CAN'T UPLOAD IT! AND IT ALSO TAKES SO LONG TO LOAD."
Gage ang dami lagi laman manong may limit yung magiging laman na gawain di na nga maawat mga teacher eh ayaw Nyo pa na kayo nalang gumawa paraan haysss Sana 1 Gawain per subject lang
daming gawain
It is bad
Nah!

I just hate school.
I am a student. I don't like google classroom. It's where all of my math is assigned. I HATE math. 🥲
This app is very bad because all teachers taking classes in holyday also💩
I dislike school
Suk my balls
"Yow, to the creator of this app I can say that your app is very helpful but It always crush because even though I already turn in my assignment and my connection is stable sometimes it really take long to turn in even it just 25kbs storage space and also when I tried to upload a video file that has less than 50 mb it take long and almost it uses almost 2Gb not a mb? why is it? I hope that this app improve and fix many bugs. Sad🤧"
L app L work L teachers
I can't take this anymore😢
"The images are not uploading even though my signal is alright, how are we supposed to pass our assignments? That's literally the whole point of the app"
I can't open files.
School
I did online quiz and I saw my score and everything Later in the morning I want back to check my score the quiz was missing which means I didn't take part and I don't know the reason why
"I cannot fathom how stressful this app is. Sometimes when I pass, it doesn't save. Sometimes it doesn't load. Sometimes, text enters quantum mode and has a spasm. Sometimes, it lags and sending documents become slow. What. What. Whatwhatwhatwhatwhat. What's worse is Google doesn't fix the bugs, at all. It's been months, years, nothing changed. I am going insane. Urge your school to choose another learning app, please. Look at other reviews, I am not alone. This app is terrible."
Ayoko na daming activities
I cant even access gc
It can only allow video of very small size to be uploaded.
I hate homework
It works completly fine on my ipad and Mac but on my phone its awfall I uninstalled and installed it again and it didn't let me put my Gmail pls help me

"Recently the app just won't open for me, it always crash whenever i try to open it. Please fix this!!"
It could barely even register if theres an assigned task and i have to go to the the browser to see if there's actually an assigned work which is really annoying since I've been using this app for almost 3 years now and it has barely improved for three years
It takes for ever to load and you cant find your work
I cant turn in today is the due date! I dont want to miss it! Fix it! Ano gang problema ha nakakasura na yang classroom na yan kung kailan pasahan ay saka dadale!

I cleaned my cache - no change. I Uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and now I no longer have access to the app (you no longer have access to this domain). It refused to let me log in. But I can still log in through my phone, laptop and tablet browsers. There is clearly some kind of issue with the app. Please address it."
Cant do half of my work
"I use this app daily, and when I say that it makes me more emo each day. I swear to God you guys are devils that ascended to live on Earth, please give me a break. You're honestly also so racist for not adding a dark mode, and I don't like people that doesn't use dark mode.

It tells me do work when my teacher posts something.
"It would be fantastic if the app told us it needed an update instead of just having us sit in a ""waiting room"" every time we try to join a video. Also, get rid of the ""rate this"" after every single video class."

"I handed in my assignment but it did not register which made me miss the deadline. There should be a new update with 0 stars. Do not recommend for teachers and schools. Also, I couldn't even open the materials using mobile, I have to use the desktop site version of my browser. If this app was a person, you'd have been aborted. EMOTIONAL DAMAGE."

I cant get an notification of new lessons in time. I always missed my exam because of this problem. I already checked my notification settings and it's in high priority app and I cannot even received one notification. I think you should solve this problem. I'm always angry because of this problem.

"You guys should be mindful of the class schedule. You better put some restrictions to teachers who are giving tasks which is beyond from their class schedule. You guys should restrict them to ONLY give and post tasks during their classes. Beyond that, they will no longer allowed to post tasks. This is to avoid conflict with our other class schedules. And also for them to be mindful of their time in and time out."

I just give this app one star because why did you made this app anyway? This app made our life even harder *cries* They put deadlines and as if the internet connection in the Philippines is very fast and my teacher didn't even consider that we have a lot of modules and they just keep on putting deadlines! I hope you will limit the activities so we can live a happy life! I wish my country cannot use this app *cries again*

I don't like it
It alwas say something wrong but my net work is so fast and i resstart and not working plz fix
Just no
Personally I think this app is a waste of time as it contains satanic content which is not appropriate for my Christian granddaughter. RE is only for god. I do not accept her learning about the homosexuals as it goes against my beliefs. Science should not be taught to my granddaughter either as she will not be learning to be a doctor. She will be a housewife like me who will learn how to treat a man how he should be treated. I will be deleting this app and I would like to speak to the manager.
It always lags. I've already update it but still not working. Please fix this immediately. Thank you
Trash
"I cant save,its not opening, i cant check files. Kindly help immediately. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. Nothing is working"
The checked file cannot be saved. This issue is not getting resolved. Please help.

Daming Gawain
Sometimes even after update it couldn't refresh and always appears something went wrong message and can't able to view pdfs
i can't save the files because it says need to update the drive but the drive is already up to the latest version of it
please put a limit to the teachers in giving activities
"Horrible, I tried to join my class and it wouldn't let me. The audio was horrible, and the camera quality was bad."

"Late receiver of the task of our classes. Ex. Yesterday had posted my teacher's task on my GELI subject but this day when I received the task on this app. I hate it, it happened several times. Can you help me?"

"You just made the app harder, instead going to the document and editing it directly, you need to go to drive and docs. And some people don't know how to edit in docs cause they don't see the upper button or just simply don't know, please make it like the past ones, I want it to be more simplified and not go to drive, docs and can't edit it."
I can’t log in any gmails in the app.

"I don't get the notifications and sometimes they don't deliver the tasks, I LOST AN EXAM BECAUSE OF THEM!"
This app sucks and I hope it burns in hell
very bad app dont download this app #waste ......
Gave me depression. 0/10 :(
For some reason the app doesn't seem to work. For example when i try going into Google classroom it doesn't seem to refresh all my classes to see my work i tried refreshing it and deleting it but still it doesn't work. It shows my assignments from a month ago but for some reason it doesn't want to refresh. I tried everything i can to fix it still doesn't work.
You can't open the files attached. what's wrong with this app?
I was going to download this so I could read something easier for one of classes but I can't even log in with my school acc. I see that other people are talking about a problem with androids and stuff and I just recently saw that I couldn't access anything anymore. Please fix this cause I don't want to have to always use my laptop just to do work. To add onto that it also doesn't allow me to log into my school acc even when I look up gc on google.

why not
not funny didn't laugh
"Bad, doesnt load right and is a pain to use in some cases."
"For the past 2 weeks the app opens, let's me open the classroom, but then crashes when I try to open the daily announcements. This is the only communication my childs school has, so its been frustrating. As I scrolled through the reviews it looks like I'm not the only one experiencing this with an Android phone. The troubleshooting that was linked from Google in someone else's previous review was no help. Google really needs to fix this for Android users!"
Why Google why
Bad app
Toliet
Non sense I can't even open any documents in my Google classroom. I already update it every update. Install and uninstall 20 times but still cannot open any documents though available offline. What a waste of time poor app
"i wad unable to view any of my classes so I tried to uninstall it to see if that would work and now anytime I try to sign into my Google classroom it says, "" you do not have access to Google classroom please contact domain administrator"". I see a lot of other people have this same issue. can this please get fixed."
Thank you so much Google classroom

To fix this, I made the mistake of deleting the app in an effort to reinstall and have it work correctly but now I cant sign into my school account at all. While scrolling through reviews, I have noticed that this syncing error is common with samsungs and androids, and my phone us one of them. Luckily, I have an ipad that works with GC. FIX FOR ANDROIDS or just say its not compatible because clearly, its not"

This is the worst app I have ever downloaded. I would absolutely rate this app 0 stars if I could. I've had to go through years of therapy due to the fact that this app has made me traumatized so many times that I've lost track. DO NOT download this app.
So bad
MARAMING OUTPUTS PERIOD.
Muy mala

It doesn't show me my work that I have to do when I try to refresh it doesn't work what should I do

"Screen recording ain't working in this app. I mean yes you can record the screen but no audio. Its hard for us student to go back to our lesson especially if the internet is weak and the subject is calculus ang p6. And also, you should limit the number of assignments a student acc can recieve, coz a lot of prof today have been taking advantage of our situation (Students at home due to pandemic) by giving alot of activities simultaneously without knowing if we are still ok."
Nagbubug Bigla bigla dumadami yung nasa todo list

"Every few months, I try and open classroom. I end up being told that it couldn't refresh. I try over and over, but the same thing ever time. I end up un-installing it, and re-installing it.

Thanks to google classroom my teachers are constantly bothering me. I already hated school and google classroom has made me hate it more
Why does the recording feature was removed? I don't see any reasons why It should have been removed! It's bad for people who aren't able to attend a class.
I hate because my phone is not well work
"When i open a pdf it shows ""unable to access the document pls make sure ur connected to the internet"" even though I'm already connected. So i updated the app and still it shows the same. I even cleared the cache and storage of google classroom and i even restarted my phone but it still shows the same."

"Whenever I try to open a file, or upload a file, it takes ridiculously long to finally get uploaded. It is infuriating because sometimes you need to turn in within a time schedule, as for an exam. So I usually try to finish my exam 10 or 15 minutes before the allotted time, because of this stupid app. I really wish you would correct this because I saw other comments quoting the same problem here. It is a wildly popular app usedby teachers as well as students, so please do something."
It removed all my classes I am unable to get access to my notes . Exam in 3 days. Now google classroom is not responding.

You guys can't make one thing properly. Any Google product has either too many bugs or a severe lack of functionality. Their troubleshooting guides are too simple and don't include the problem. Their forums have generic answers by so called experts that literally are common sense which no one asked for.

I get the concept of the app and how it's supposed to benefit in the way where everything is organized but the majority of teachers just use it as a scapegoat for teaching and give assignments on pre recored lessons like edpuzzle or gizmo labs and such
can you say why my account school cannit work i try but sync is not working 😭
It was a very toxic app and wwanst good for mental health AT ALL. Never happy when I get notifications from this app. 0/10 do not recommend.
Kontooool
"Please fix your app. I can't even open my teacher's podcast. I'm reviewing my lessons but because of your app's issue I'm not able to review. Our deadline is near, please be considerate. 😒"

"Worst app I've ever had. (This is a lie) the app runs smoothly but I'd say having to click multiple buttons to turn in an assignment sucks, when other apps like google docs, let you turn them in with a single click. Other than that it's a good app."

Horrible aplicación.

I've had multiple instances where I was stressed out beyond belief due to multiple floods of assignments coming in. Most of them were finished as well I might add. I've also had multiple people in multiple different schools have the same problems and fight the stressful long nights and afternoons having to do assignment after assignment and fight the lag and ludicrous ways of this app."
Cant log in

I you add dark mode and make it optional it would be better on most people's eyes

We are dissatisfied to how this app work
It is telling me I don't have access to my classroom i showed my teacher and she doesn't know what to do PLEASE FIX!!!
I can't open the sinend to do. what's going on in googleclassroom will this app crash?

it's literally broken? I can't submit my photos and the layout in some of the assignments are broken
Too many homeworks to do
"When my teachers upload a pdf, videos or anything, I can't open it but if I open gclassroom on chrome it works perfectly fine."
"Fix your app. Every time I refresh my to do or missing list, everything I already done shows up as missing or undone."
So bad never works for what I want to do.
"It's rubbish, it doesn't even sign in to your account. Do not download this app."
"No one likes homework, and ur app has so many bugs"
Yes no
The teachers should never use this app as it is extremely poorly set up and deserves to be taken down.
File is not uploading
NEVER POSSIBLE

I hate this app my child found my sex education class on this app i need better safe storage on this app.
"Since jan 7th 2022 all google products like google meet google classroom,drive etc are showing signs of distruption .... There has been several situations in which only the session host ,my drive owner as well as classroom head can open files specified using drive as in new material, whiteboard, brainstorming charts can't be viewed by visitors or tjose who needs to acess it. the main problem for classroom is it provides pdf and other files which may be viewable to the admin/owner/head only."
"When I pass my quiz or assignment it always say ""class not found"""
Amazing would give it 10 if I could.
Bad app
"Filled with bugs, laggy, private comments don't appear, hard to navigate without help. It is good for school, but almost unbearable to use."
Not able to open any class videos ..It only buffers and video doesnt open at all

If this happens everyday then he'll miss all the class and he re installed this app again and when he opens that app and tries to start it with his e mail I'd which is given in the class, it said cannot found account or something went wrong. Then he'll miss all his classes"

"When l'm opening this application it is showing 'get started' when I am clicking on it it is showing 'We are sorry , but you don't have access to Classroom'. But I have access, in other smart phone it is alright but I don't know why it is showing this. I can't rate it 0 stars. It's the worst application"

Nadula akun answer sa Filipino ka submit nako pru
It's school based what did you expect?
0/10
The app in general is un necessary. My reasoning are that it is very annoying to manage and too complicated. It also is unnecessary because you can just use email.
"Used to work well last semester, I dont know what happened. Says that it is experiencing problems and assignments dont load."
"Do you please tell me why it always shows (Woohoo, no work due soon!)even when my classes started"
"How can this app be SO badly coded? You can't fix even the basic stuff... a year ago this app was good: it was responsive, it showed me the assignments I had to complete, had notifications (before you removed it from the app just to come back with them again), etc. Nowadays it's completely useless. It's not reliable, takes an incredible amount of time to refresh, removes assignments from my ""completed"" tab, etc. How is it possible that a company as big as Google develops a product like this?"
Bad
Hate this app
Terrible
"Loading in so slow, not properly working, links are an error. Nothing even works properly, it is very bad app, Do Not Recommend. Notifications not working at all."
This is a cheap website. It doesnt help your children learn anything. Im a student myself and havent learn anything yet.
Searching for classroom is hyping this app. Let Mr search Google.
App not working
Just bad
so bad
"I am using this app since last year. But now with new version i got fully disappointed . When I go to my previous year classrooms to send the same pdf files in this session ,the option has been disappeared and asking for link and all. It's a request Kindly, updated the old version only. Please take it this seriously. So much problem we are going through with this new version. Totally disappointed."

I do not want to go to class and this app aways says something went wrong 😒 like be real
Bad app
"Please consider putting an option in each classroom where files or modules can be organize. Like adding Folder than can be renamed. It's so tiring to scroll back and forth to look for the added classwork, modules, activities, assignments etc they're all mixed up. It's giving us so much headache. I hope you'll be able to look into this idea."
"The files won't open no matter how many times I tap to open, how am I supposed to do my assignments properly if I can't see them?"
Hate school

Won't allow me to sign into my Google classroom. I have an existing class and the app is asking to sign in as a new user and creating a new account. After choosing new user account it is giving me a new email. I have a personal Gmail and it isn't my google classroom email. I uninstalled the app 2x and have turned my Google pixel 6 pro many times. Frustrated with the quality of this app. Not user friendly!
I can't refresh and can't see the updates

It also constantly makes me join back into my classes because I get kicked out for some reason. I'm disappointed with this app. Maybe if they fix these problems I will fix my review but till then it stays at a 1."

"It is very dissapointing that when I insert documents, videos, and images, it will load nonestop. I've had been waiting for my video to load but it's been so long, it's wasting my time. If I would be honest, my internet connection is not good but it's not also bad, as of the momment i'm only the one using the wifi so, it's impossible that it's because of my wifi that it load nonestop. I just hope you will fix this ☺︎︎"

"G CLASSROOM used to be an excellent app for students to upload their work. I updated the G CLASSROOM a few weeks ago and I must say that I regret my decision. With the latest update, the app has become absolutely pathetic! I have not been able to submit any of my work for a long time, everytime I try to do so, it shows, ""Can't submit drive file"", ""Something went wrong, try again"" and I keep trying until it gets irritating. I can't upload any pdf or jpg file even after reinstalling it many times."
"I am here to redownload again😠, it keeps bringing a blank page each time i try opening the note lecturers dropped."

I was panicking because my assignment was due 11:59pm only and when it was already 12am that was the only time na nagpass siya?! are you kidding me!! Pinaglololoko niyo ba ako ha?!"
"Bug that says that I can't refresh my classes, forced to use browser version instead."

"This app before was easy and fine to use, but now? It isn't. I tried entering into my online class by pressing the camera/video icon but it says that I can't connect to the video call. It only works on my tablet, not on my phone. I usually use my phone for classes when I'm busy working on my tablet ( My phone is perfectly fine, for your information ) it also says that I refreshed the app 3 months ago, I really don't understand this. If you can fix this then please do, its frustrating..."

Also sometimes the notifications for when somebody post something in it you won't get notified or you will get notified but it's late. You'll get it after like a couple of hours and it sucks specially when you're waiting for your test/quiz and others were already starting and you're just waiting for it to appeared on theapp"

For some reason it says that I have homework missing from classes from 2017-2019. I don't even have access to those classes anymore. I have tried going to those assignments but there's no turn it or mark as done button. I tried updating it but that's also not an option. It says I have 18 assignments missing when I don't. Please fix.

"Really laggy and doesn't work on my phone, it works on my computer but not my phone. Please fix this!"
"It's so great, I would've given it 5 stars if I had never experienced what I'm about to say. What's the point in having a submit button if the teacher has access to my work before I even press the submit button. I started my work then stopped halfway. I went back on the document to continue only to see that my teacher already posted negative comments on the document that I CLEARLY DIDN'T FINISH AND DIDN'T SUBMIT😡"

Since the recent update my teachers cannot see my work when its uploaded. It says something about the file being curropted. None of the work that I upload a teacher can see. Sometimes I can not upload one sheet of work until about five times and more. I am high school student and I lost grades because of this issue. Please fix this for me. Can you give me a email so I can send screenshots of the issue.

Honestly this is a good app but it lags a lot even with good internet thanks to google classroom we had to buy a new wifi conection 2 times! And it barely works on a iphone and a tablet and with the computer is even worse if thier was a 0 sfar I would do it.
Horrible
"For some reason I do not have access to my classrooms, even though I'm choosing the right account. Whenever I do have access, it says ""Something went wrong."" Please fix this app."

"After the recent update, downloading an attachment has become a big headache.. resolve this issue."
garbage. slower than my braincells at 2am
This won't even let sign in to my account

"Whenever I want to attach files, photos, and documents it takes forever to be attached and sometimes it crashes for no reason please work on that"
Nice app
I hate to the core
Have a limit
No school!!!!
"The old version of this app is better, because now, it's very difficult to insert pictures, videos or files and endless loading, there are times when I'm late in passing tasks even though I did my assignment early. It's just sad that the effort I put in just to do it early seems worthless, because the app didn’t work well even though the internet connection was strong."

Too much homework
I am rating this one because nowadays I'm not getting the notes which teachers are posting on it
I can't save files offline it's nonsense says always to turn off turn off transfer files over wifi only in drive but l already kept it off please fix this Bugg 😡😡
It consumes a lot of data when we apply files for offline even a 500kb pdf also consumes over 100mbs It is too costly
It was freaking terrible
It takes too much time to load the files. FIX IT DUMMY
Notification Spam
Worst da😫😫
I hate this app it's not bad it's just no🤢
Very useful to teachers but not us
"I'm facing problem while opening pdf files in my phone. (Error code:something went wrong, try again, Unable to open this file) Please look into this issue & let us know as soon as earlier."
"The app is good and all but it will not show me my classes for this year, and I can't get the codes from my teachers."
"With the terribly slow upload speeds, on any wifi connection, the hard to understand use, the unstable logins and much more you would think google would spend more time fixing this. In times like now this app could help save us all but instead it only makes things harder and more frustrating for students and teachers alike. I expected better from a company as big as google. It's barely deserving of the one star rating I have given it and it's overall 2.6 stars."
"Terrible app. If I could leave -5 stars, I would. It wont let me upload assignments that are crucial to me passing my classes, usually the assignments that are worth the most amount of my grade. Should be taken off the app store. I failed 4 classes (in the last year) due to this app. I never want to have to use it again. It is very unfortunate because it was a very good app before this happened, but now I cant trust it to get my assignments uploaded, nor loaded or turned in. Again, terrible app."
I have to do work on this app😤

I studied the wrong stuff due to my teacher being unclear on Google classroom, so when I went to my physical school the next day, I had a test I literally got a 0%. EDIT: a few months later... My teachers are finally learning to use Google classroom properly, but google classroom is more of a 'notes' app. We need an app that allows us to do school work, not a notes app. Trying to figure out what is due and when is a huge struggle"

"This app is good and helpful, but when my teacher puts in a question for us to answer and we have to submit, it won't let us. This is because the ""turn in button"" covers the private comments box, and makes your keyboard pop back up for us to type. I then have to rotate my screen in order for the private comments to be at the bottom, and then able to turn in my assignment. Please fix this."

"Terrible app. The moment the app finished downloading, I looked around and my fridge was gone. My TV fell off the wall and smashed and my ps4 grew legs and jumped out of the window. All social media apps on my phone vanished except for YouTube, which was stuck on lofi girl. A stack of assessment books broke down the door and devoured my sister and my dog. When I opened the app, my face transformed into a 2018 test paper. I have been stuck here for hours. Download this at your own risk."

This sucks!! This app is the worst app in the whole galaxy!! I can never learn on this again!!
"Dark mode on Google classroom is one of the most requested feature since ages. I don't understand why this app still doesn't have dark mode built in. Students spend a lot of time staring at this app daily, so it's more of a necessity than an optional feature. I hope this would get implemented soon."
Bad 👎

Worst experience with the latest version of this app. Can't open even a short pdf !!!
"Hello, I'm having a great problem with this app's scanner. When I click the second pic, it shows I have clicked only 1 pic. When I finally clicked 11 pics of my assignments, and uploaded the pdf, it showed that the pdf has only 1 page, that is the last pic I took. All my progress lost, I tried to make the pdf all over again, but the same problem continues. Doing my assignment early has gone in vain. Please fix this problem 🙏🏻 Thank you."

Please fix this because it is so bothering and concerning to a student like me who doesn't get a choice but to use this app."
"the app is really great in every thing else, but the fact that it doesn't show the exact time of submission of our works (just shows handed in done/done late) affected us so much in our studies. if a feature such as that showing the exact time of submission (done on time/late) would i have given this a five star"
Why online class?

Absolutely terrible app. I wasn't able to upload so I restarted my phone and updated the app and now I am removed from all my classrooms and I have to submit the assignment within 1 hour otherwise I am in big trouble. Tell your school/college/office to never use this app.

"The app crashes a lot and when marking a student's paper, all my work can just disappear without being saved because the app doesn't save my work in real time. This wastes a HUGE deal of my time especially when marking many papers.

💩💩💩💩
This app always crashes I can't open my schoolwork too! 😑
"Shows me error all the time while submiting any of my assignments. This app sucks. Because of this app I'm dealing so much. I just want to die. My teachers think I'm making an excuse of not submitting assignments, but this app is not allowing me to submit cause it shows me error all the time.."

Crashed my computer and I couldn't use it for half an hour
Kaam Karna padta hai yaar😞
